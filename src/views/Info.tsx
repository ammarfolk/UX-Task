        The Nobel Prizes "Nobelpriset" are five separate prizes that, according
        to Alfred Nobel's will of 1895, are awarded to "those who, during the
        preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind."
        Alfred Nobel was a Swedish chemist, engineer, and industrialist most
        famously known for the invention of dynamite. He died in 1896. In his
        will, he bequeathed all of his "remaining realisable assets" to be used
        to establish five prizes which became known as "Nobel Prizes." Nobel
        Prizes were first awarded in 1901.
